In my research, I investigate how infants and children learn about the complex auditory structures that constitute their environment, such as music and speech. Here, I adopt a systems framework of infant and child development, where knowledge about complex auditory structures is thought to arise from organism-environment interactions that begin during the pre-natal period. To probe how children learn about auditory structures, I employ methodologies that capture system-wide dynamics at the neural level (e.g., electroencephalography) and behavioral level (e.g., perceptual paradigms). More recently, I’ve begun to incorporate dynamical models of neural oscillations to examine the mechanisms (e.g., self-organization, pattern formation) underlying infants’ and children’s processing of musical structure. Additionally, I am also interested in using these models to generate developmental predictions of music acquisition over developmental timescales. While contributing to a basic body of scientific knowledge, this research also has strong implications for intervention and remediation strategies involving music, such rhythm and music therapy for reading-related disorders (e.g., dyslexia).

### Dynamical Systems Models of Music Development

Over the course of development, typically developing infants and children learn to coordinate perception-action to culture-specific rhythmic structures that constitute their native music. How does our perception of and our ability to coordinate action to musical rhythm change across development? Further, what developmental mechanisms might explain these changes?

In one line of work, I am developing a series of developmental models, inspired by a dynamical systems model of neural oscillation, to explain how developmental changes in music perception-action might arise from changes in the coupling of neural and bodily oscillations over ontogeny. Current work demonstrates how oscillatory models 1) can acccount for age-related changes in infants' perception of native and non-native musical rhythms and 2) music-movement interactions that influence infant rhythm perception.

In a seperate line of work, I am investigating phase-locked responses in the auditory system (e.g., the frequency-following response) and relations between auditory processing in the brainstem (e.g., the auditory brainstem response) and higher-level skills, such as reading and language. Current work suggests that changes in the spectral amplitude of the frequency-following response, when recorded at the scalp, may reflect patterns of phase construction and deconstruction of multiple, phase-locked signals throughout the auditory system. Other work suggests that temporal processing in the brainstem (e.g., neural-conduction times) relate to reading subskills, even in adulthood.

## Scientific Outreach 

### Neural Symphony

In collaboration with my colleague (and former PhD adviser!) Erika Skoe, I created a sample library of neural responses that are mapped to the piano keyboard. The project, called [Neural Symphony](https://skoelab.uconn.edu/neural-symphony/), enables anyone to produce, play, and compose music using the unique timbre of the brain. 

In my teaching, I've found that this project is an excellent demonstration of phase-locking dynamics in the auditory system and illustrates how the "arts" and the "sciences" can be beautifully united. The project was also featured on an episode of the University of Connecticut's podcast. You can listen [here](https://uconn.edu/uconn360-podcast/episode-3-play-us-a-song-youre-the-piano-brain/).
