## Teaching Awards
As a graduate student, I received the **Provostâ€™s Teaching Excellence Letter** in 2019, an award given to instructors of record who display exceptional teaching abilities. 
Additionally, I consistently surpassed the average student-evalulation scores across all graduate-level teaching assistants.

## Selected Student Evaluations

"Professor Parker puts the material into his own words, but is so well spoken and also relates to students very well. I believe he is the best lecturer I have had at UCONN thus far."

"This was my favorite class all semester and probably ever. A really great teacher and very nice."

"Very helpful. Available. Really cared about the success of his students. Made class interesting. By far my favorite professor this semester."

"Parker made a somewhat boring and technical class very interesting and fun. He successfully facilitated discussion in class and developed a great rapport with every student in the class."

"Parker was the best TA!!!!!!"
