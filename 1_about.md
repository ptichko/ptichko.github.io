I’m a developmental and cognitive neuroscientist interested in the dynamics of language, music, and infant-child development. In my research, I use computational and dynamical-systems modeling (e.g., neural networks, oscillatory networks), electrophysiology (e.g., EEG), and behavioral measurements to understand how infants and children acquire language and music skills. 
Before entering graduate school, I was the lab manager for Dr. Erin E. Hannon’s [Auditory Cognition and Development Lab](https://www.ehannon.faculty.unlv.edu//Home.html) for 2+ years. 
I received my PhD., as a National Science Foundation (NSF) IGERT Fellow in [Language Plasticity](http://www.igert.org/projects/282.html) at the University of Connecticut, under the guidance of Drs. Ed Large and Erika Skoe in the [Music Dynamics Lab](https://musicdynamicslab.uconn.edu/) and [Auditory Brain Research (ABR) Lab](https://skoelab.uconn.edu/). Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [MIND Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/mindlab/) at Northeastern University under the advisement of Dr. Psyche Loui.

In addition to my research interests, I am an active musician, composer, and producer, having previously worked in the music-manufacturing industry and written about music education and computer music prior to returning to graduate school. In 2012, I authored a book about teaching music in the classroom with a popular DAW called Mixcraft. The book has proven to be a useful resource for music educators and is currently being distributed by Hal Leonard, the world’s leading publisher of sheet music. In 2014, I worked in the music industry as the lead copywriter and content-creator for a top-five music technology and instrument company. Later that year, I returned to graduate school to pursue a doctorate in psychological science.

**Great thinkers who influenced me:** [Leonard B. Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_B._Meyer), [Gilbert Gottlieb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Gottlieb), [Erin Hannon](http://ehannon.faculty.unlv.edu//home.html), [Jan Malášek](https://www.pololu.com/blog/engage-your-brain), [Dan Goldstein](https://acoustica.com/company/)

**Great manuscripts that influenced me:**
It is a rare occurrence to encounter a manuscript that, with striking clarity and erudition, manages to reveal, overturn, and even confute wrongly held assumptions on the part of the reader, or worse, an entire scientific field. Gathered here is a list of manuscripts that, over the span of my intellectual trajectory, have done just that. Many of these articles describe dynamical systems approaches to cognition, perception-action, development, and music, and reflect my continuing transition,  as scientist, from a reductionist framework to a complexity framework.
